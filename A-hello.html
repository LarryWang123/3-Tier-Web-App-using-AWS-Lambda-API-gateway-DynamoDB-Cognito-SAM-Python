  <h1>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h1>
  <p>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings. AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.
  <p>AWS launched in 2006 from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.</p>
  </p>
  <p>AWS offers many different tools and solutions for enterprises and software developers that can be used in data centers in up to 190 countries. Groups such as government agencies, education institutions, nonprofits and private organizations can use AWS services.</p>
  <p>More than 100 services comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio, including those for compute, databases, infrastructure management, application development and security.</p>

    <td>Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides scalable object storage for data backup, collection and analytics. An IT professional stores data and files as S3 objects -- which can range up to 5 gigabytes (GB) -- inside S3 buckets to keep them organized. A business can save money with S3 through its Infrequent Access storage tier or by using Amazon Glacier for long-term cold storage.

    <td>AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014.

      Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, and C# (through .NET) are all officially supported as of 2018. In late 2018, custom runtime support was added to AWS Lambda.
      
      AWS Lambda supports running native Linux executables via calling out from a supported runtime such as Node.js. For example, Haskell code can be run on Lambda.
